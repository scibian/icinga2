## Debug Icinga 2 <a id="development-debug"></a>

This chapter targets all users who have been asked by developers to provide
a stack trace or coredump if the application crashed. It is also useful
for developers working with different debuggers.

> **Note:**
>
> This is intentionally mentioned before any development insights
> as debugging is a more frequent and commonly asked question.

### Debug Requirements <a id="debug-requirements"></a>

Make sure that the debug symbols are available for Icinga 2.
The Icinga 2 packages provide a debug package which must be
installed separately for all involved binaries, like `icinga2-bin`
or `icinga2-ido-mysql`.

Distribution       | Command
-------------------|------------------------------------------
Debian/Ubuntu      | `apt-get install icinga2-dbg`
RHEL/CentOS        | `yum install icinga2-debuginfo`
Fedora             | `dnf install icinga2-debuginfo icinga2-bin-debuginfo icinga2-ido-mysql-debuginfo`
SLES/openSUSE      | `zypper install icinga2-bin-debuginfo icinga2-ido-mysql-debuginfo`

Furthermore, you may also have to install debug symbols for Boost and your C++ library.

If you're building your own binaries, you should use the `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` cmake
build flag for debug builds.


### GDB as Debugger <a id="development-debug-gdb"></a>

Install GDB in your development environment.

Distribution       | Command
-------------------|------------------------------------------
Debian/Ubuntu      | `apt-get install gdb`
RHEL/CentOS        | `yum install gdb`
Fedora             | `dnf install gdb`
SLES/openSUSE      | `zypper install gdb`

#### GDB Run <a id="development-debug-gdb-run"></a>

Call GDB with the binary (`/usr/sbin/icinga2` is a wrapper script calling
`/usr/lib64/icinga2/sbin/icinga2` since 2.4) and all arguments and run it in foreground.

```
gdb --args /usr/lib64/icinga2/sbin/icinga2 daemon -x debug
```

The exact path to the Icinga 2 binary differs on each distribution. On Ubuntu
it is installed into `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/icinga2/sbin/icinga2` on 64-bit systems
for example.

> **Note**
>
> If gdb tells you it's missing debug symbols, quit gdb and install
> them: `Missing separate debuginfos, use: debuginfo-install ...`

Run/restart the application.

```
(gdb) r
```

Kill the running application.

```
(gdb) k
```

Continue after breakpoint.

```
(gdb) c
```

#### GDB Core Dump <a id="development-debug-gdb-coredump"></a>

Either attach to the running process using `gdb -p PID` or start
a new gdb run.

```
(gdb) r
(gdb) generate-core-file
```

#### GDB Backtrace <a id="development-debug-gdb-backtrace"></a>

If Icinga 2 aborted its operation abnormally, generate a backtrace.

> **Note**
>
> Please install the [required debug symbols](21-development.md#debug-requirements)
> prior to generating a backtrace.

`thread apply all` is important here since this includes all running threads.
We need this information when e.g. debugging dead locks and hanging features.

```
(gdb) bt
(gdb) thread apply all bt full
```

If gdb stops at a SIGPIPE signal please disable the signal before
running Icinga 2. This isn't an error, but we need to workaround it.

```
(gdb) handle SIGPIPE nostop noprint pass
(gdb) r
```

If you create a [new issue](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/issues),
make sure to attach as much detail as possible.

#### GDB Backtrace from Running Process <a id="development-debug-gdb-backtrace-running"></a>

If Icinga 2 is still running, generate a full backtrace from the running
process and store it into a new file (e.g. for debugging dead locks).

> **Note**
>
> Please install the [required debug symbols](21-development.md#debug-requirements)
> prior to generating a backtrace.

Icinga 2 runs with 2 processes: main and command executor, therefore generate two backtrace logs
and add them to the GitHub issue.

```
for pid in $(pidof icinga2); do gdb -p $pid -batch -ex "thread apply all bt full" -ex "detach" -ex "q" > gdb_bt_${pid}_`date +%s`.log; done
```

#### GDB Thread List from Running Process <a id="development-debug-gdb-thread-list-running"></a>

Instead of a full backtrace, you sometimes just need a list of running threads.

```
for pid in $(pidof icinga2); do gdb -p $pid -batch -ex "info threads" -ex "detach" -ex "q" > gdb_threads_${pid}_`date +%s`.log; done
```

#### GDB Backtrace Stepping <a id="development-debug-gdb-backtrace-stepping"></a>

Identifying the problem may require stepping into the backtrace, analysing
the current scope, attributes, and possible unmet requirements. `p` prints
the value of the selected variable or function call result.

```
(gdb) up
(gdb) down
(gdb) p checkable
(gdb) p checkable.px->m_Name
```

#### GDB Breakpoints <a id="development-debug-gdb-breakpoint"></a>

To set a breakpoint to a specific function call, or file specific line.

```
(gdb) b checkable.cpp:125
(gdb) b icinga::Checkable::SetEnablePerfdata
```

GDB will ask about loading the required symbols later, select `yes` instead
of `no`.

Then run Icinga 2 until it reaches the first breakpoint. Continue with `c`
afterwards.

```
(gdb) run
(gdb) c
```

In case you want to step into the next line of code, use `n`. If there is a
function call where you want to step into, use `s`.

```
(gdb) n

(gdb) s
```

If you want to delete all breakpoints, use `d` and select `yes`.

```
(gdb) d
```

> **Tip**
>
> When debugging exceptions, set your breakpoint like this: `b __cxa_throw`.

Breakpoint Example:

    (gdb) b __cxa_throw
    (gdb) r
    (gdb) up
    ....
    (gdb) up
    #11 0x00007ffff7cbf9ff in icinga::Utility::GlobRecursive(icinga::String const&, icinga::String const&, boost::function<void (icinga::String const&)> const&, int) (path=..., pattern=..., callback=..., type=1)
        at /home/michi/coding/icinga/icinga2/lib/base/utility.cpp:609
    609			callback(cpath);
    (gdb) l
    604
    605	#endif /* _WIN32 */
    606
    607		std::sort(files.begin(), files.end());
    608		BOOST_FOREACH(const String& cpath, files) {
    609			callback(cpath);
    610		}
    611
    612		std::sort(dirs.begin(), dirs.end());
    613		BOOST_FOREACH(const String& cpath, dirs) {
    (gdb) p files
    $3 = std::vector of length 11, capacity 16 = {{static NPos = 18446744073709551615, m_Data = "/etc/icinga2/conf.d/agent.conf"}, {static NPos = 18446744073709551615,
        m_Data = "/etc/icinga2/conf.d/commands.conf"}, {static NPos = 18446744073709551615, m_Data = "/etc/icinga2/conf.d/downtimes.conf"}, {static NPos = 18446744073709551615,
        m_Data = "/etc/icinga2/conf.d/groups.conf"}, {static NPos = 18446744073709551615, m_Data = "/etc/icinga2/conf.d/notifications.conf"}, {static NPos = 18446744073709551615,
        m_Data = "/etc/icinga2/conf.d/satellite.conf"}, {static NPos = 18446744073709551615, m_Data = "/etc/icinga2/conf.d/services.conf"}, {static NPos = 18446744073709551615,
        m_Data = "/etc/icinga2/conf.d/templates.conf"}, {static NPos = 18446744073709551615, m_Data = "/etc/icinga2/conf.d/test.conf"}, {static NPos = 18446744073709551615,
        m_Data = "/etc/icinga2/conf.d/timeperiods.conf"}, {static NPos = 18446744073709551615, m_Data = "/etc/icinga2/conf.d/users.conf"}}


### Core Dump <a id="development-debug-core-dump"></a>

When the Icinga 2 daemon crashes with a `SIGSEGV` signal
a core dump file should be written. This will help
developers to analyze and fix the problem.

#### Core Dump File Size Limit <a id="development-debug-core-dump-limit"></a>

This requires setting the core dump file size to `unlimited`.


##### Systemd

```
systemctl edit icinga2.service

[Service]
...
LimitCORE=infinity

systemctl daemon-reload

systemctl restart icinga2
```

##### Init Script

```
vim /etc/init.d/icinga2
...
ulimit -c unlimited

service icinga2 restart
```

##### Verify

Verify that the Icinga 2 process core file size limit is set to `unlimited`.

```
for pid in $(pidof icinga2); do cat /proc/$pid/limits; done

...
Max core file size        unlimited            unlimited            bytes
```


#### Core Dump Kernel Format <a id="development-debug-core-dump-format"></a>

The Icinga 2 daemon runs with the SUID bit set. Therefore you need
to explicitly enable core dumps for SUID on Linux.

```
sysctl -w fs.suid_dumpable=2
```

Adjust the coredump kernel format and file location on Linux:

```
sysctl -w kernel.core_pattern=/var/lib/cores/core.%e.%p

install -m 1777 -d /var/lib/cores
```

MacOS:

```
sysctl -w kern.corefile=/cores/core.%P

chmod 777 /cores
```

#### Core Dump Analysis <a id="development-debug-core-dump-analysis"></a>

Once Icinga 2 crashes again a new coredump file will be written. Please
attach this file to your bug report in addition to the general details.

Simple test case for a `SIGSEGV` simulation with `sleep`:

```
ulimit -c unlimited
sleep 1800&
[1] <PID>
kill -SEGV <PID>
gdb `which sleep` /var/lib/cores/core.sleep.<PID>
(gdb) bt
rm /var/lib/cores/core.sleep.*
```

Analyzing Icinga 2:

```
gdb /usr/lib64/icinga2/sbin/icinga2 core.icinga2.<PID>
(gdb) bt
```

### LLDB as Debugger <a id="development-debug-lldb"></a>

LLDB is available on macOS with the Xcode command line tools.

```
$ xcode-select --install
```

In order to run Icinga 2 with LLDB you need to pass the binary as argument.

```
lldb -- /usr/local/icinga2/lib/icinga2/sbin/icinga2 daemon
```

Breakpoint:

```
> b checkable.cpp:57
> b icinga::Checkable::ProcessCheckResult
```

Full backtrace:

```
> bt all
```

Select thread:

```
> thr sel 5
```

Step into:

```
> s
```

Next step:

```
> n
```

Continue:

```
> c
```

Up/down in stacktrace:

```
> up
> down
```



## Develop Icinga 2 <a id="development-develop"></a>

Icinga 2 can be built on many platforms such as Linux, Unix and Windows.
There are limitations in terms of support, e.g. Windows is only supported for agents,
not a full-featured master or satellite.

Before you start with actual development, there is a couple of pre-requisites.

### Choose your Editor <a id="development-develop-choose-editor"></a>

Icinga 2 can be developed with your favorite editor. Icinga developers prefer
these tools:

- vim
- CLion (macOS, Linux)
- MS Visual Studio (Windows)
- Atom

Editors differ on the functionality. The more helpers you get for C++ development,
the faster your development workflow will be.


#### Whitespace Cleanup <a id="development-develop-choose-editor-whitespaces"></a>

Patches must be cleaned up and follow the indent style (tabs instead of spaces).
You should also remove any training whitespaces.

`git diff` allows to highlight such.

```
vim $HOME/.gitconfig

[color "diff"]
        whitespace = red reverse
[core]
        whitespace=fix,-indent-with-non-tab,trailing-space,cr-at-eol
```

`vim` also can match these and visually alert you to remove them.

```
vim $HOME/.vimrc

highlight ExtraWhitespace ctermbg=red guibg=red
match ExtraWhitespace /\s\+$/
autocmd BufWinEnter * match ExtraWhitespace /\s\+$/
autocmd InsertEnter * match ExtraWhitespace /\s\+\%#\@<!$/
autocmd InsertLeave * match ExtraWhitespace /\s\+$/
autocmd BufWinLeave * call clearmatches()
```

### Get to know the architecture <a id="development-develop-get-to-know-the-architecture"></a>

Icinga 2 can run standalone or in distributed environments. It contains a whole lot
more than a simple check execution engine.

Read more about it in the [Technical Concepts](19-technical-concepts.md#technical-concepts) chapter.

### Get to know the code <a id="development-develop-get-to-know-the-code"></a>

First off, you really need to know C++ and portions of C++11 and the boost libraries.
Best is to start with a book or online tutorial to get into the basics.
Icinga developers gained their knowledge through studies, training and self-teaching
code by trying it out and asking senior developers for guidance.

Here's a few books we can recommend:

* [Accelerated C++: Practical Programming by Example](https://www.amazon.com/Accelerated-C-Practical-Programming-Example/dp/020170353X) (Andrew Koenig, Barbara E. Moo)
* [Effective C++](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Specific-Improve-Programs-Designs/dp/0321334876) (Scott Meyers)
* [Der C++ Programmierer](https://www.amazon.de/Programmierer-lernen-Professionell-anwenden-L%C3%B6sungen/dp/3446416447), German (Ulrich Breymann)
* [C++11 programmieren](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/3836217325/), German (Torsten T. Will)

In addition, it is a good bet to also know SQL when diving into backend development.

* [SQL Performance Explained](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/3950307826/) (Markus Winand)

Last but not least, if you are developing on Windows, get to know the internals about services and the Win32 API.


### Design Patterns <a id="development-develop-design-patterns"></a>

Icinga 2 heavily relies on object-oriented programming and encapsulates common
functionality into classes and objects. It also uses modern programming techniques
to e.g. work with shared pointer memory management.

Icinga 2 consists of libraries bundled into the main binary. Therefore you'll
find many code parts in the `lib/` directory wheras the actual application is
built from `icinga-app/`. Accompanied with Icinga 2, there's the Windows plugins
which are standalone and compiled from `plugins/`.

Library        | Description
---------------|------------------------------------
base           | Objects, values, types, streams, tockets, TLS, utilities, etc.
config         | Configuration compiler, expressions, etc.
cli            | CLI (sub) commands and helpers.
icinga         | Icinga specific objects and event handling.
remote         | Cluster and HTTP client/server and REST API related code.
checker        | Checker feature, check scheduler.
notification   | Notification feature, notification scheduler.
methods        | Command execution methods, plugins and built-in checks.
perfdata       | Performance data related, including Graphite, Elastic, etc.
db\_ido        | IDO database abstraction layer.
db\_ido\_mysql | IDO database driver for MySQL.
db\_ido\_pgsql | IDO database driver for PgSQL.
mysql\_shin    | Library stub for linking against the MySQL client libraries.
pgsql\_shim    | Library stub for linking against the PgSQL client libraries.

#### Class Compiler <a id="development-develop-design-patterns-class-compiler"></a>

Another thing you will recognize are the `.ti` files which are compiled
by our own class compiler into actual source code. The meta language allows
developers to easily add object attributes and specify their behaviour.

Some object attributes need to be stored over restarts in the state file
and therefore have the `state` attribute set. Others are treated as `config`
attribute and automatically get configuration validation functions created.
Hidden or read-only REST API attributes are marked with `no_user_view` and
`no_user_modify`.

The most beneficial thing are getters and setters being generated. The actual object
inherits from `ObjectImpl<TYPE>` and therefore gets them "for free".

Example:

```
vim lib/perfdata/gelfwriter.ti

  [config] enable_tls;

vim lib/perfdata/gelfwriter.cpp

    if (GetEnableTls()) {
```

The logic is hidden in `tools/mkclass/` in case you want to learn more about it.
The first steps during CMake & make also tell you about code generation.


### Builds: CMake <a id="development-develop-builds-cmake"></a>

In its early development stages in 2012, Icinga 2 was built with autoconf/automake
and separate Windows project files. We've found this very fragile, and have changed
this into CMake as our build tool.

The most common benefits:

* Everything is described in CMakeLists.txt in each directory
* CMake only needs to know that a sub directory needs to be included.
* The global CMakeLists.txt acts as main entry point for requirement checks and library/header includes.
* Separate binary build directories, the actual source tree stays clean.
* CMake automatically generates a Visual Studio project file `icinga2.sln` on Windows.

### Builds: Unity Builds <a id="development-develop-builds-unity-builds"></a>

Another thing you should be aware of: Unity builds on and off.

Typically, we already use caching mechanisms to reduce recompile time with ccache.
For release builds, there's always a new build needed as the difference is huge compared
to a previous (major) release.

Therefore we've invented the Unity builds, which basically concatenates all source files
into one big library source code file. The compiler then doesn't need to load the many small
files but compiles and links this huge one.

Unity builds require more memory which is why you should disable them for development
builds in small sized VMs (Linux, Windows) and also Docker containers.

There's a couple of header files which are included everywhere. If you touch/edit them,
the cache is invalidated and you need to recompile a lot more files then. `base/utility.hpp`
and `remote/zone.hpp` are good candidates for this.


### Linux Dev Environment <a id="development-linux-dev-env"></a>

Based on CentOS 7, we have an early draft available inside the Icinga Vagrant boxes:
[centos7-dev](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-vagrant/tree/master/centos7-dev).

If you're compiling Icinga 2 natively without any virtualization layer in between,
this usually is faster. This is also the reason why developers on macOS prefer native builds
over Linux or Windows VMs. Don't forget to test the actual code on Linux later! Socket specific
stuff like `epoll` is not available on Unix kernels.

Depending on your workstation and environment, you may either develop and run locally,
use a container deployment pipeline or put everything in a high end resource remote VM.

Fork https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2 into your own repository, e.g. `https://github.com/dnsmichi/icinga2`.

Create two build directories for different binary builds.

* `debug` contains the debug build binaries. They contain more debug information and run tremendously slower than release builds from packages. Don't use them for benchmarks.
* `release` contains the release build binaries, as you would install them on a live system. This helps comparing specific scenarios for race conditions and more.

```
mkdir -p release debug
```

Proceed with the specific distribution examples below.

* [CentOS 7](21-development.md#development-linux-dev-env-centos)
* [Debian 9](21-development.md#development-linux-dev-env-debian)

### macOS Dev Environment <a id="development-macos-dev-env"></a>

It is advised to use Homebrew to install required build dependencies.
Macports have been reported to work as well, typically you'll get more help
with Homebrew from Icinga developers.

#### Users and Groups

First off, create the following from `Settings - Users & Groups`:

* Users: `icinga`
* Groups: `icinga` with `icinga` as member
* Groups: `icingaweb2`

Then disallow login for these users.

```
dscl
list Local/Default/Users
read Local/Default/Users/icinga
change Local/Default/Users/icinga UserShell /bin/bash /usr/bin/false
sudo dscl . create /Users/icinga IsHidden 1
sudo dseditgroup -o edit -a _www -t user icingaweb2
```

#### Requirements

OpenSSL 1.0.x doesn't build anymore, so we're explicitly using 1.1.x here.

```
brew install ccache boost cmake bison flex yajl openssl@1.1 mysql-connector-c++ postgresql libpq
```

##### ccache

```
sudo mkdir /opt/ccache

sudo ln -s `which ccache` /opt/ccache/clang
sudo ln -s `which ccache` /opt/ccache/clang++

vim $HOME/.bashrc

# ccache is managed with symlinks to avoid collision with cgo
export PATH="/opt/ccache:$PATH"

source $HOME/.bashrc
```

#### Builds

We will build two different flavors on macOS.

```
mkdir -p release debug

cd debug
cmake -DICINGA2_UNITY_BUILD=OFF -DICINGA2_WITH_STUDIO=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/icinga2 -DOPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/include -DOPENSSL_SSL_LIBRARY=/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib/libssl.dylib -DOPENSSL_CRYPTO_LIBRARY=/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib/libcrypto.dylib ..
cd ..

make -j4 -C debug
sudo make -j4 install -C debug
```

##### Build Aliases

This is derived from dnsmichi's flavour and not generally best practice.

```
vim $HOME/.bashrc

export PATH=/usr/local/icinga2/sbin/:$PATH
source /usr/local/icinga2/etc/bash_completion.d/icinga2

export I2_GENERIC="-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/icinga2 -DOPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/include -DOPENSSL_SSL_LIBRARY=/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib/libssl.dylib -DOPENSSL_CRYPTO_LIBRARY=/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib/libcrypto.dylib -DICINGA2_PLUGINDIR=/usr/local/sbin"

export I2_DEBUG="-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DICINGA2_UNITY_BUILD=OFF $I2_GENERIC"
export I2_RELEASE="-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DICINGA2_WITH_TESTS=ON -DICINGA2_UNITY_BUILD=ON $I2_GENERIC"

alias i2_debug="mkdir -p debug; cd debug; cmake $I2_DEBUG ..; make -j4; sudo make -j4 install; cd .."
alias i2_release="mkdir -p release; cd release; cmake $I2_RELEASE ..; make -j4; sudo make -j4 install; cd .."

source $HOME/.bashrc
```

#### Run

```
chown -R icinga:icinga /usr/local/icinga2
chown -R icinga:_www /usr/local/icinga2/var/run/icinga2/cmd

icinga2 daemon
```

#### Plugins

```
brew install nagios-plugins

sudo vim /usr/local/icinga2/etc/icinga2/constants.conf
const PluginDir = "/usr/local/sbin"

### Windows Dev Environment <a id="development-windows-dev-env"></a>

The following sections explain how to setup the required build tools
and how to run and debug the code.

#### Chocolatey

Open an administrative command prompt (Win key, type “cmd”, right-click and “run as administrator”) and paste the following instructions:

```
@powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin
```

#### Visual Studio

Thanks to Microsoft they’ll now provide their Professional Edition of Visual Studio 2017
as community version, free for use for open source projects such as Icinga.
The installation requires ~9GB disk space. [Download](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/)
the web installer and start the installation.

You need a free Microsoft account to download and also store your preferences.

Choose the following minimal set:

* .NET Framework 4.x SDK
* C# Compiler
* Visual Studio C++ core features
* VC++ toolset
* Windows 10 SDK (10.0.10240.0 - required)
* Just-in-time debugger
* Windows 8 SDK (includes mscoree.lib required by clrchecktask)
* C++/CLI support
* Windows Universal C Runtime
* Git for Windows
* .NET Framework 3.5 development tools
* Github extension for Visual Studio

After a while, Visual Studio will be ready.

#### .NET Framework 3.5

Windows 10 only have .NET Framework >= 4.6 installed by default, the Icinga Agent Wizard is built on .NET Framework 2.0 which is not included in .NET Framework 4.6. Thankfully Windows 10 have .NET Framework 3.5 (which includes .NET Framework 2.0) as a component on board, you just need to activate it.

Go to `Control Panel` -> `Programs` -> `Turn Windows features on or off`. Tick `.NET Framework 3.5 (includes .NET 2.0 and 3.0)` and wait until the installation process succseded.

#### Flex and Bison

Install it using [chocolatey](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/ChSetupWin32.html):

```
choco install -y winflexbison
```

Chocolatey installs these tools into the hidden directory `C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\winflexbison\tools`.

#### OpenSSL

Icinga 2 requires the OpenSSL library. [Download](http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html)
and install it into the default path.

Once asked for `Copy OpenSSLs DLLs to` select `The Windows system directory`. That way CMake/Visual Studio
will automatically detect them for builds and packaging.

> **Note**
>
> We cannot use the chocolatey package as this one does not provide any development headers.
>
> Choose 1.0.2 LTS from manual downloads for best compatibility if unsure.

#### Boost

In order to use the boost development header and library files you need to [download](http://www.boost.org/users/download/)
Boost and then extract it to e.g. `C:\boost_1_65_1`.

> **Note**
>
> Just use `C:`, the zip file already contains the sub folder. Extraction takes a while,
> the archive contains more than 10k files.

For integrating Boost into Visual Studio 2017, open the `Developer Command Prompt` from the start menu,
and navigate to `C:\boost_1_65_1`.

Execute `bootstrap.bat` first.

```
cd C:\boost_1_65_1
bootstrap.bat
```

Once finished, specify the required `toolset` to compile boost against Visual Studio.
This takes quite some time in a Windows VM.

Visual Studio 2015:

```
b2 --toolset=msvc-14.0
```

Visual Studio 2017:

```
b2 --toolset=msvc-14.1
```

#### TortoiseGit

TortoiseGit provides a graphical integration into the Windows explorer. This makes it easier to checkout, commit
and whatnot.

[Download](https://tortoisegit.org/download/) TortoiseGit on your system.

In order to clone via Git SSH you also need to create a new directory called `.ssh`
inside your user's home directory.
Therefore open a command prompt (win key, type `cmd`, enter) and run `mkdir .ssh`.
Add your `id_rsa` private key and `id_rsa.pub` public key files into that directory.

Start the setup routine and choose `OpenSSH` as default secure transport when asked.

Open a Windows Explorer window and navigate into

Version             | Project Location
--------------------|------------------------------
Visual Studio 2015  | `C:\Users\michi\Documents\Visual Studio 2015\Projects`
Visual Studio 2017+ | `C:\Users\michi\source\repos`

Right click and select `Git Clone` from the context menu.

Use `ssh://git@github.com/icinga/icinga2.git` for SSH clones, `https://github.com/icinga/icinga2.git` otherwise.

#### CMake

Icinga 2 uses CMake to manage the build environment. You can generate the Visual Studio project files
using CMake. [Download](https://cmake.org/download/) and install CMake. Select to add it to PATH for all users
when asked.

Once setup is completed, open a command prompt and navigate to

Visual Studio 2015

```
cd C:\Users\<username>\Documents\Visual Studio 2015\Projects\icinga2
```

Visual Studio 2017

```
cd C:\Users\michi\source\repos
```

Run CMake with the following command. This generates a new Visual Studio project file called `icinga2.sln`.

You need to specify the previously installed component paths:

Variable              | Value                                                                | Description
----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------
`BOOST_ROOT`          | `C:\boost_1_65_1`                                                    | Root path where you've extracted and compiled Boost.
`BISON_EXECUTABLE`    | `C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\winflexbison\tools\win_bison.exe`     | Path to the Bison executable.
`FLEX_EXECUTABLE`     | `C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\winflexbison\tools\win_flex.exe`      | Path to the Flex executable.
`ICINGA2_WITH_MYSQL`  | OFF                                                                  | Requires extra setup for MySQL if set to `ON`. Not supported for client setups.
`ICINGA2_WITH_PGSQL`  | OFF                                                                  | Requires extra setup for PgSQL if set to `ON`. Not supported for client setups.
`ICINGA2_UNITY_BUILD` | OFF                                                                  | Disable unity builds for development environments.

Tip: If you have previously opened a terminal, run `refreshenv` to re-read updated PATH variables.

```
cmake . -DBOOST_ROOT=C:\boost_1_65_1 -DBISON_EXECUTABLE=C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\winflexbison\tools\win_bison.exe -DFLEX_EXECUTABLE=C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\winflexbison\tools\win_flex.exe -DICINGA2_WITH_MYSQL=OFF -DICINGA2_WITH_PGSQL=OFF -DICINGA2_UNITY_BUILD=OFF
```

Best is write a small batch/Powershell script which just executes these lines.


#### Icinga 2 in Visual Studio

Navigate to

Version             | Project location
--------------------|-------------------------
Visual Studio 2015  | `C:\Users\michi\Documents\Visual Studio 2015\Projects\icinga2`
Visual Studio 2017+ | `C:\Users\michi\source\repos\icinga2`

Open `icinga2.sln`. Log into Visual Studio when asked.

On the right panel, select to build the `Bin/icinga-app` solution.

The executable binaries are located in `Bin\Release\Debug` in your `icinga2`
project directory.

Navigate there and run `icinga2.exe --version`.

Example for Visual Studio 2017:

```
cd C:\Users\michi\source\repos\icinga2\Bin\Release\Debug
icinga2.exe --version
```


#### Release Package

CMake uses CPack and NSIS to create the setup executable including all binaries and libraries
in addition to setup dialogues and configuration. Therefore we’ll need to install [NSIS](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download)
first.

We also need to install the Windows Installer XML (WIX) toolset.

```
choco install -y wixtoolset
```

Once completed open an administrative shell and navigate to your Visual Studio project.
Let CMake to build a release package.

```
cd "c:\Users\michi\Documents\Visual Studio 2015\Projects\icinga2"
cmake --build . --target PACKAGE --config Release
```

Note: This will still use the debug builds. A yet more clean approach
is to run CMake with changed release parameters beforehand and then
re-run the release package builder.

```
C:\Users\michi\Documents\Visual Studio 2015\Projects\icinga2>
cmake . -DCPACK_GENERATOR=WIX -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBOOST_ROOT=C:\boost_1_65_1 -DBISON_EXECUTABLE=C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\winflexbison\tools\win_bison.exe -DFLEX_EXECUTABLE=C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\winflexbison\tools\win_flex.exe -DICINGA2_WITH_MYSQL=OFF -DICINGA2_WITH_PGSQL=OFF -DICINGA2_UNITY_BUILD=OFF

cmake --build . --target PACKAGE --config Release
```

Again, put these lines into a batch/Powershell script and execute that.



### Embedded Dev Env: Pi <a id="development-embedded-dev-env"></a>

> **Note**
>
> This isn't officially supported yet, just a few hints how you can do it yourself.

The following examples source from armhf on Raspberry Pi.

#### ccache

```
apt install -y ccache

/usr/sbin/update-ccache-symlinks

echo 'export PATH="/usr/lib/ccache:$PATH"' | tee -a ~/.bashrc

source ~/.bashrc && echo $PATH
```

#### Build

Copy the icinga2 source code into `$HOME/icinga2`. Clone the `deb-icinga2` repository into `debian/`.

```
git clone https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2 $HOME/icinga2
git clone https://github.com/Icinga/deb-icinga2 $HOME/icinga2/debian
```

Then build a Debian package and install it like normal.
```
dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us
```

## Package Builds <a id="development-package-builds"></a>

This documentation is explicitly meant for packagers and the Icinga
build infrastructure.

The following requirements need to be fulfilled in order to build the
Icinga application using a dist tarball (including notes for distributions):

* cmake >= 2.6
* GNU make (make) or ninja-build
* C++ compiler which supports C++11
  - RHEL/Fedora/SUSE: gcc-c++ >= 4.7 (extra Developer Tools on RHEL5/6 see below)
  - Debian/Ubuntu: build-essential
  - Alpine: build-base
  - you can also use clang++
* pkg-config
* OpenSSL library and header files >= 1.0.1
  - RHEL/Fedora: openssl-devel
  - SUSE: libopenssl-devel (for SLES 11: libopenssl1-devel)
  - Debian/Ubuntu: libssl-dev
  - Alpine: libressl-dev
* Boost library and header files >= 1.48.0
  - RHEL/Fedora: boost148-devel
  - Debian/Ubuntu: libboost-all-dev
  - Alpine: boost-dev
* GNU bison (bison)
* GNU flex (flex) >= 2.5.35
* Systemd headers
  - Only required when using Systemd
  - Debian/Ubuntu: libsystemd-dev
  - RHEL/Fedora: systemd-devel

### Optional features <a id="development-package-builds-optional-features"></a>

* MySQL (disable with CMake variable `ICINGA2_WITH_MYSQL` to `OFF`)
  - RHEL/Fedora: mysql-devel
  - SUSE: libmysqlclient-devel
  - Debian/Ubuntu: default-libmysqlclient-dev | libmysqlclient-dev
  - Alpine: mariadb-dev
* PostgreSQL (disable with CMake variable `ICINGA2_WITH_PGSQL` to `OFF`)
  - RHEL/Fedora: postgresql-devel
  - Debian/Ubuntu: libpq-dev
  - postgresql-dev on Alpine
* YAJL (Faster JSON library)
  - RHEL/Fedora: yajl-devel
  - Debian: libyajl-dev
  - Alpine: yajl-dev
* libedit (CLI console)
  - RHEL/Fedora: libedit-devel on CentOS (RHEL requires rhel-7-server-optional-rpms)
  - Debian/Ubuntu/Alpine: libedit-dev
* Termcap (only required if libedit doesn't already link against termcap/ncurses)
  - RHEL/Fedora: libtermcap-devel
  - Debian/Ubuntu: (not necessary)

### Special requirements <a id="development-package-builds-special-requirements"></a>

**FreeBSD**: libexecinfo (automatically used when Icinga 2 is installed via port or package)

**RHEL6**: Requires a newer boost version which is available on packages.icinga.com
with a version suffixed name.

### Runtime user environment <a id="development-package-builds-runtime-user-env"></a>

By default Icinga will run as user `icinga` and group `icinga`. Additionally the
external command pipe and livestatus features require a dedicated command group
`icingacmd`. You can choose your own user/group names and pass them to CMake
using the `ICINGA2_USER`, `ICINGA2_GROUP` and `ICINGA2_COMMAND_GROUP` variables.

```
# groupadd icinga
# groupadd icingacmd
# useradd -c "icinga" -s /sbin/nologin -G icingacmd -g icinga icinga
```

On Alpine (which uses ash busybox) you can run:

```
# addgroup -S icinga
# addgroup -S icingacmd
# adduser -S -D -H -h /var/spool/icinga2 -s /sbin/nologin -G icinga -g icinga icinga
# adduser icinga icingacmd
```

Add the web server user to the icingacmd group in order to grant it write
permissions to the external command pipe and livestatus socket:

```
# usermod -a -G icingacmd www-data
```

Make sure to replace "www-data" with the name of the user your web server
is running as.

### Building Icinga 2: Example <a id="development-package-builds-example"></a>

Once you have installed all the necessary build requirements you can build
Icinga 2 using the following commands:

```
$ mkdir release && cd release
$ cmake ..
$ cd ..
$ make -C release
$ make install -C release
```

You can specify an alternative installation prefix using `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`:

```
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/tmp/icinga2
```

### CMake Variables <a id="development-package-builds-cmake-variables"></a>

In addition to `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` here are most of the supported Icinga-specific cmake variables.

For all variables regarding defaults paths on in CMake, see
[GNUInstallDirs](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/GNUInstallDirs.html).

Also see `CMakeLists.txt` for details.

**Build Optimization**
- `ICINGA2_UNITY_BUILD`: Whether to perform a unity build; defaults to `ON`. Note: This requires additional memory and is not advised for building VMs, Docker for Mac and embedded hardware.
- `ICINGA2_LTO_BUILD`: Whether to use link time optimization (LTO); defaults to `OFF`

**Init System**
- `USE_SYSTEMD=ON|OFF`: Use systemd or a classic SysV initscript; defaults to `OFF`
- `INSTALL_SYSTEMD_SERVICE_AND_INITSCRIPT=ON|OFF` Force install both the systemd service definition file
  and the SysV initscript in parallel, regardless of how `USE_SYSTEMD` is set.
  Only use this for special packaging purposes and if you know what you are doing.
  Defaults to `OFF`.

**Features:**
- `ICINGA2_WITH_CHECKER`: Determines whether the checker module is built; defaults to `ON`
- `ICINGA2_WITH_COMPAT`: Determines whether the compat module is built; defaults to `ON`
- `ICINGA2_WITH_DEMO`: Determines whether the demo module is built; defaults to `OFF`
- `ICINGA2_WITH_HELLO`: Determines whether the hello module is built; defaults to `OFF`
- `ICINGA2_WITH_LIVESTATUS`: Determines whether the Livestatus module is built; defaults to `ON`
- `ICINGA2_WITH_NOTIFICATION`: Determines whether the notification module is built; defaults to `ON`
- `ICINGA2_WITH_PERFDATA`: Determines whether the perfdata module is built; defaults to `ON`
- `ICINGA2_WITH_TESTS`: Determines whether the unit tests are built; defaults to `ON`

**MySQL or MariaDB:**

The following settings can be tuned for the MySQL / MariaDB IDO feature.

- `ICINGA2_WITH_MYSQL`: Determines whether the MySQL IDO module is built; defaults to `ON`
- `MYSQL_CLIENT_LIBS`: Client implementation used (mysqlclient / mariadbclient); defaults searches for `mysqlclient` and `mariadbclient`
- `MYSQL_INCLUDE_DIR`: Directory containing include files for the mysqlclient; default empty -
  checking multiple paths like `/usr/include/mysql`

See [FindMySQL.cmake](third-party/cmake/FindMySQL.cmake) for the implementation.

**PostgreSQL:**

The following settings can be tuned for the PostgreSQL IDO feature.

- `ICINGA2_WITH_PGSQL`: Determines whether the PostgreSQL IDO module is built; defaults to `ON`
- `PostgreSQL_INCLUDE_DIR`: Top-level directory containing the PostgreSQL include directories
- `PostgreSQL_LIBRARY`: File path to PostgreSQL library : libpq.so (or libpq.so.[ver] file)

See [FindMySQL.cmake](third-party/cmake/FindPostgreSQL.cmake) for the implementation.

**Version detection:**

CMake determines the Icinga 2 version number using `git describe` if the
source directory is contained in a Git repository. Otherwise the version number
is extracted from the [VERSION](VERSION) file. This behavior can be
overridden by creating a file called `icinga-version.h.force` in the source
directory. Alternatively the `-DICINGA2_GIT_VERSION_INFO=OFF` option for CMake
can be used to disable the usage of `git describe`.


### Building RPMs <a id="development-package-builds-rpms"></a>

#### Build Environment on RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, Amazon Linux

Setup your build environment:

```
yum -y install rpmdevtools
```

#### Build Environment on SuSE/SLES

SLES:

```
zypper addrepo http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:tools/SLE_12_SP4/devel:tools.repo
zypper refresh
zypper install rpmdevtools spectool
```

OpenSuSE:

```
zypper addrepo http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:tools/openSUSE_Leap_15.0/devel:tools.repo
zypper refresh
zypper install rpmdevtools spectool
```

#### Package Builds <a id="development-package-builds-rpms-package-builds"></a>

Prepare the rpmbuild directory tree:

```
cd $HOME
rpmdev-setuptree
```

Snapshot builds:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Icinga/rpm-icinga2/master/icinga2.spec -o $HOME/rpmbuild/SPECS/icinga2.spec
```

> **Note**
>
> The above command builds snapshot packages. Change to the `release` branch
> for release package builds.

Copy the tarball to `rpmbuild/SOURCES` e.g. by using the `spectool` binary
provided with `rpmdevtools`:

```
cd $HOME/rpmbuild/SOURCES
spectool -g ../SPECS/icinga2.spec

cd $HOME/rpmbuild
```

Install the build dependencies. Example for CentOS 7:

```
yum -y install libedit-devel ncurses-devel gcc-c++ libstdc++-devel openssl-devel \
cmake flex bison boost-devel systemd mysql-devel postgresql-devel httpd \
selinux-policy-devel checkpolicy selinux-policy selinux-policy-doc
```

Note: If you are using Amazon Linux, systemd is not required.

A shorter way is available using the `yum-builddep` command on RHEL based systems:

```
yum-builddep SPECS/icinga2.spec
```

Build the RPM:

```
rpmbuild -ba SPECS/icinga2.spec
```

#### Additional Hints <a id="development-package-builds-rpms-additional-hints"></a>

##### SELinux policy module

The following packages are required to build the SELinux policy module:

* checkpolicy
* selinux-policy (selinux-policy on CentOS 6, selinux-policy-devel on CentOS 7)
* selinux-policy-doc

##### RHEL/CentOS 6

The RedHat Developer Toolset is required for building Icinga 2 beforehand.
This contains a modern version of flex and a C++ compiler which supports
C++11 features.
```
cat >/etc/yum.repos.d/devtools-2.repo <<REPO
[testing-devtools-2-centos-\$releasever]
name=testing 2 devtools for CentOS $releasever
baseurl=https://people.centos.org/tru/devtools-2/\$releasever/\$basearch/RPMS
gpgcheck=0
REPO
```

Dependencies to devtools-2 are used in the RPM SPEC, so the correct tools
should be used for building.

As an alternative, you can use newer Boost packages provided on
[packages.icinga.com](https://packages.icinga.com/epel).
```
cat >$HOME/.rpmmacros <<MACROS
%build_icinga_org 1
MACROS
```

##### Amazon Linux

If you prefer to build packages offline, a suitable Vagrant box is located
[here](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/mvbcoding/boxes/awslinux/).

##### SLES 11

The Icinga repository provides the required boost package version and must be
added before building.

### Build Debian/Ubuntu packages <a id="development-package-builds-deb"></a>

Setup your build environment on Debian/Ubuntu, copy the 'debian' directory from
the Debian packaging Git repository (https://github.com/Icinga/deb-icinga2)
into your source tree and run the following command:

```
dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us
```

### Build Alpine Linux packages <a id="development-package-builds-alpine"></a>

A simple way to setup a build environment is installing Alpine in a chroot.
In this way, you can set up an Alpine build environment in a chroot under a
different Linux distro.
There is a script that simplifies these steps with just two commands, and
can be found [here](https://github.com/alpinelinux/alpine-chroot-install).

Once the build environment is installed, you can setup the system to build
the packages by following [this document](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Creating_an_Alpine_package).

### Build Post Install Tasks <a id="development-package-builds-post-install-tasks"></a>

After building Icinga 2 yourself, your package build system should at least run the following post
install requirements:

* enable the `checker`, `notification` and `mainlog` feature by default
* run 'icinga2 api setup' in order to enable the `api` feature and generate SSL certificates for the node

### Run Icinga 2 <a id="development-package-builds-run-icinga"></a>

Icinga 2 comes with a binary that takes care of loading all the relevant
components (e.g. for check execution, notifications, etc.):

```
icinga2 daemon

[2016-12-08 16:44:24 +0100] information/cli: Icinga application loader (version: v2.5.4-231-gb10a6b7; debug)
[2016-12-08 16:44:24 +0100] information/cli: Loading configuration file(s).
[2016-12-08 16:44:25 +0100] information/ConfigItem: Committing config item(s).
...
```

#### Init Script <a id="development-package-builds-init-script"></a>

Icinga 2 can be started as a daemon using the provided init script:

```
/etc/init.d/icinga2
Usage: /etc/init.d/icinga2 {start|stop|restart|reload|checkconfig|status}
```

#### Systemd <a id="development-package-builds-systemd"></a>

If your distribution uses Systemd:

```
systemctl {start|stop|reload|status|enable|disable} icinga2
```

In case the distribution is running Systemd >227, you'll also
need to package and install the `etc/initsystem/icinga2.service.limits.conf`
file into `/etc/systemd/system/icinga2.service.d`.

#### openrc <a id="development-package-builds-openrc"></a>

Or if your distribution uses openrc (like Alpine):

```
rc-service icinga2
Usage: /etc/init.d/icinga2 {start|stop|restart|reload|checkconfig|status}
```

Note: the openrc's init.d is not shipped by default.
A working init.d with openrc can be found here: (https://git.alpinelinux.org/cgit/aports/plain/community/icinga2/icinga2.initd). If you have customized some path, edit the file and adjust it according with your setup.
Those few steps can be followed:

```
wget https://git.alpinelinux.org/cgit/aports/plain/community/icinga2/icinga2.initd
mv icinga2.initd /etc/init.d/icinga2
chmod +x /etc/init.d/icinga2
```

Icinga 2 reads a single configuration file which is used to specify all
configuration settings (global settings, hosts, services, etc.). The
configuration format is explained in detail in the [doc/](doc/) directory.

By default `make install` installs example configuration files in
`/usr/local/etc/icinga2` unless you have specified a different prefix or

## Advanced Development Tips <a id="development-advanced"></a>

### GDB Pretty Printers <a id="development-advanced-gdb-pretty-printer"></a>

Install the `boost`, `python` and `icinga2` pretty printers. Absolute paths are required,
so please make sure to update the installation paths accordingly (`pwd`).

    $ mkdir -p ~/.gdb_printers && cd ~/.gdb_printers

Boost Pretty Printers compatible with Python 3:

    $ git clone https://github.com/mateidavid/Boost-Pretty-Printer.git && cd Boost-Pretty-Printer
    $ git checkout python-3
    $ pwd
    /home/michi/.gdb_printers/Boost-Pretty-Printer

Python Pretty Printers:

    $ cd ~/.gdb_printers
    $ svn co svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/trunk/libstdc++-v3/python

Icinga 2 Pretty Printers:

    $ mkdir -p ~/.gdb_printers/icinga2 && cd ~/.gdb_printers/icinga2
    $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Icinga/icinga2/master/tools/debug/gdb/icingadbg.py

Now you'll need to modify/setup your `~/.gdbinit` configuration file.
You can download the one from Icinga 2 and modify all paths.

Example on Fedora 22:

    $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Icinga/icinga2/master/tools/debug/gdb/gdbinit -O ~/.gdbinit
    $ vim ~/.gdbinit

    set print pretty on
    
    python
    import sys
    sys.path.insert(0, '/home/michi/.gdb_printers/icinga2')
    from icingadbg import register_icinga_printers
    register_icinga_printers()
    end
    
    python
    import sys
    sys.path.insert(0, '/home/michi/.gdb_printers/python')
    from libstdcxx.v6.printers import register_libstdcxx_printers
    try:
        register_libstdcxx_printers(None)
    except:
        pass
    end
    
    python
    import sys
    sys.path.insert(0, '/home/michi/.gdb_printers/Boost-Pretty-Printer')
    import boost_print
    boost_print.register_printers()
    end


If you are getting the following error when running gdb, the `libstdcxx`
printers are already preloaded in your environment and you can remove
the duplicate import in your `~/.gdbinit` file.

    RuntimeError: pretty-printer already registered: libstdc++-v6


## Development Tests <a id="development-tests"></a>

Build the binaries and run the tests.


```
make -j4 -C debug
make test -C debug
```

Run a specific boost test:

```
debug/Bin/Debug/boosttest-test-base --run_test=remote_url
```
